.DESCRIPTION
This script will allow you to make a copy of all volumes that are a member of specified FlashArray Protection Group,
which can be based on most recent pgroup snapshot or a specified pgroup snapshot

.EXAMPLE
.\fa-pgroup-snap-copy-interactive.ps1 -faendpoint 10.21.234.191 -ProtectionGroupName clonetestingpgroup -ProtectionGroupAndVolumeCopySuffixes "-copy1,-copy2"
Connects to array at 10.21.234.191 with specified credentials and makes volume copies from most recent snapshot of clonetestingpgroup with specified count/suffixes of -copy1 and -copy2

.\fa-pgroup-snap-copy-interactive.ps1 -faendpoint 10.21.234.191 -ProtectionGroupName clonetestingpgroup -ProtectionGroupAndVolumeCopySuffixes "-copy1,-copy2" -ProtectionGroupSnapshotName clonetestingpgroup.7
Connects to array at 10.21.234.191 with specified credentials and makes volume copies from specified 'clonetestingpgroup.7' snapshot of clonetestingpgroup with specified count/suffixes of -copy1 and -copy2
